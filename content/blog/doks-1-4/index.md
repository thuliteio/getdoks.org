## Highlights

- [Link cards shortcode](#link-cards-shortcode)
- [Improved sidebar navigation](#improved-sidebar-navigation)

## Link cards shortcode

You can now use the `{{</* link-card */>}}` shortcode to link prominently to different pages.

A `{{</* link-card */>}}` requires a `title` and an [`href`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#href) attribute. You can optionally include a short `description` or other link attributes such as `target`.

{{< link-card
  title="Showcase"
  description="Explore the infinite possibilities of Doks"
  href="/showcase/"
  target="_blank"
>}}

```md
{{</* link-card
  title="Showcase"
  description="Explore the infinite possibilities of Doks"
  href="/showcase/"
  target="_blank"
*/>}}
```

## Improved sidebar navigation

By default, Doks will automatically generate a sidebar based on the filesystem structure of your documentation, using each file's `title` property as the sidebar entry.

For example, given the following file structure:

```md
.
└──content/
   └───docs/
       ├───guides/
       │   ├───_index.md
       │   └───example.md
       reference/
       │   ├───_index.md
       │   └───example.md
       └───_index.md
```

The following sidebar will be automatically generated:

{{< img src="images/section-navigation-light.png" alt="Section navigation light variant" class="img-lightmode border" >}}
{{< img src="images/section-navigation-dark.png" alt="Section navigation dark variant" class="img-darkmode border" >}}

Sections can be collapsed by default by setting the `collapsed` property to `true` in the frontmatter of a section’s `_index.md`.

Sidebar navigation is also available for other `docs` based sections you create. Read more about [sidebar navigation](https://getdoks.org/docs/basics/navigation/#sidebar) in our documentation.
