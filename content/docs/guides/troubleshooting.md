Use the [project configuration](/docs/reference/configuration/) and [individual page frontmatter configuration](/docs/reference/frontmatter/) reference pages to ensure that your Doks site is configured and functioning properly. See the guides in the sidebar for help adding content and customizing your Doks site.

If your answer cannot be found in these docs, please visit the [full Thulite Docs](https://docs.thulite.io/) for complete Thulite documentation. Your question may be answered by understanding how Thulite works in general, underneath this Doks theme.

You can also check for any known [Doks issues on GitHub](https://github.com/thuliteio/doks/issues), and get help in [Doks Discussions](https://github.com/thuliteio/doks/discussions) from our active, friendly community!
