## Development and Build Process

Doks uses modern web development tools and follows Hugo's conventions:

- **Hugo**: Static site generator for fast, secure websites
- **Thulite**: Framework providing integrations and enhanced functionality
- **Bootstrap**: CSS framework for responsive design and components
- **SCSS**: Enhanced CSS with variables, mixins, and modular styling
- **FlexSearch**: Client-side search with no external dependencies
- **KaTeX**: Fast math typesetting for mathematical notation
- **Tabler Icons**: Beautiful SVG icon set
- **Node.js ecosystem**: NPM/Yarn/PNPM/Bun package management

The build process compiles SCSS to CSS, processes JavaScript, optimizes images, and generates static HTML files that can be deployed to any web server or CDN.
